BetterBahn is a web app for finding the best train journeys in Germany. This tool helps you navigate the rail system efficiently, focusing on cost-effective travel options. While split ticketing can help save money, it is not the primary method for booking. The app will continue to evolve with more features in the future.

BetterBahn leverages the [db-vendo-client](https://github.com/public-transport/db-vendo-client) to access Deutsche Bahn ticketing data. This allows you to get real-time information on train schedules and ticket options. This client is licensed under the ISC License, ensuring a wide range of use.
